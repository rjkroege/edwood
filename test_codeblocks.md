# Testing Code Blocks

This is a test file for verifying code block rendering.

## Inline Code

Here is some `inline code` in a sentence.

Multiple `inline` code `spans` in one line.

## Fenced Code Blocks

Here is a Go code block:

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

And here is a plain code block:

```
just some code
with multiple lines
    and indentation
```

## Mixed Content

Some text before the code block.

```
code inside
```

Some text after the code block.

## Horizontal Rules

Testing horizontal rules with different syntaxes:

Three hyphens:

---

Three asterisks:

***

Three underscores:

___

With spaces between:

- - -

* * *

_ _ _

More than three:

-----

*****

_____

## End

That's all for code block and horizontal rule testing.
