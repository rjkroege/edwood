# Good morning functions
Useful Go functions (based on the fact that I've needed them in more than one
project.)

* `Editinacme` is a pure-Go `plumber`-free function largely mimic-ing the
operation of the `B` command from Plan9Port. Note the availability of the
`Addtotag` option to append text to the tag.
